    <h1>Bullshit</h1>
      <h2>By Young Rog & Summer Walker</h2>
        <p>[Chorus: Young Rog]
        I'm so used to the bullshit
        It's steady drivin' me crazy
        And I don't mean to come on strong
        That's just how I feel, baby (Oh, oh)
        I'm so used to the bullshit (Oh)
        It's steady drivin' me crazy (Oh)
        And I don't mean to come on strong (Oh)
        That's just how I, that's just how I—
        </p>

        <p>
        [Verse 1: Young Rog]
        Why you look so crazy?
        It's your fault anyway
        How you tell me I'm bad for you?
        Yet you showed me the opposite
        It's crazy 'cause now I need you
        If you're gone, I'll fade away
        As if this was your plan
        From the very first night
        </p>
        
        <p>
        [Chorus: Young Rog & Summer Walker]
        I'm so used to the bullshit
        It's steady drivin' me crazy
        And I don't mean to come on strong
        That's just how I feel, baby (Oh, oh)
        I'm so used to the bullshit (Oh)
        It's steady drivin' me crazy (Oh)
        And I don't mean to come on strong (Oh, oh)
        That's just how I, that's just how I—
        </p>

        <p>
        [Verse 2: Summer Walker]
        I really wish you'd hear me from a different sidе
        But there's no tellin' you nothing bеcause you always right
        'Cause I know that I'm right about what I seen last night
        And if you seen what I seen, then you'd know why I'm leavin'
        Won't burn your clothe or bust your windows out your car
        'Cause I ain't fuckin' up the shit you know I bought
        Far from who you got me confused with
        And I blocked your number 'cause you still on that bullshit (Bullshit)
        </p>

        <p>
        [Chorus: Young Rog & Summer Walker]
        I'm so used to the bullshit (So used to it)
        It's steady drivin' me crazy (Oh)
        And I don't mean to come on strong (Oh, oh)
        That's just how I feel, baby
        I'm so used to the bullshit (So)
        It's steady drivin' me crazy
        And I don't mean to come on strong (Strong)
        That's just how I, that's just how I—
        </p>
        
        <p>
        [Outro: Young Rog & Summer Walker]
        Baby, baby, roll with it
        No, baby, let go with it
        Oh, baby
        Oh, baby
        Take that
        Baby, baby, roll with it (Oh)
        No, baby, let go with it (Oh)
        Oh, baby
        Oh, baby
        Take that, yeah
      </p>
